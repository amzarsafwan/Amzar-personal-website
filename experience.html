            <p><strong>Team:</strong> TEAM SP</p>
            <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Top 2 in MEL Kebangsaan</p>

            <p>
                I was part of TEAM SP, competing in the PUBG Mobile National Championship (PMNC). 
                We successfully reached the finals and secured 2nd place in MEL Kebangsaan, a national-level competition. 
                The journey was intense and competitive, pushing me to develop strong teamwork, communication, and tactical gaming skills.

            <h3>Sports – Rugby Player for Kedah U18</h3>
            <p><strong>Team:</strong> Kedah U18 Rugby Team</p>
            <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2019</p>
            <p>
                I represented Kedah in the Under-18 state rugby team in 2019. Competing at this level was a proud moment in my life. 
                Rugby taught me the value of discipline, physical strength, resilience, and leadership on the field. 
                Being part of a state team also helped me build strong bonds with fellow athletes and coaches.
